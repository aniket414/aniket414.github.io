          Developed an identity as a service API's to authenticate and authorize identity of individuals and applications. The service supported the <mark>OpenID Connect</mark>, <mark>SAML</mark>, <mark>Authorize Code</mark>, <mark>Password</mark>, <mark>Client Credentials</mark>, <mark>Authorize Code with PKCE</mark> and <mark>Refresh Token</mark> flow. Created a serverless <mark>AWS Lambda</mark> which triggered every day to report users data on daily basis for analytics purpose. Used AWS managed <mark>Kafka</mark> for data streaming. In addition also performed threat modelling and supported penetration testing team. Made sure the penetration testing issues are immediately fixed to make the system secure before its prod release.

          Developed a profile as a service using <mark>GraphQL</mark> to manage the profile data of individuals. Utilized GraphQL to read, write, update and delete only the sections of profile as requested by the user. Also incorporated the CCPA (US) and GDPR (EU) to comply with the act and also made sure the encryption of PII data.

          I started this project as a final year undergrad project to learn <mark>Machine Learning</mark>. The model was trained using <mark>LSTM</mark> <mark>RNN</mark> algorithm to predict the solar power generated. The project had a interactice UI where the user selects the city name and in the backend the future weather data of the city was fetched using <mark>REST API</mark> and sent to the trained model which predicted the solar power generation.

          I am currently enrolled here as a full time *Masters of Science* graduate student in *Computer Science* with specialization in *Machine Learning*. I plan to take software development and machine learning related courses to broaden my ideas around it.

          This is just the starting of my time at University, there's a lot more that I need to learn here. Will keep everyone posted, stay tuned.

          During my degree at Pune University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to my advantage in my day to day work.

          While at University I served as *Technical Secretary*, managed labs, students requirement and ran weekly meetings to oversee progress of task in the department. During this time I also organized a department level inter college technical festival which was a huge success.

          I also had an wonderful experience working as a *Campus Ambassador* for the initiative *Transform Maharashtra*. Promoted the event and encouraged students to participate in sharing their ideas on how to tackle major problems being faced by the State Government of Maharashtra. Alongside promotion, I also managed the end to end interaction of participants with the organizers effectively resolving their queries.
