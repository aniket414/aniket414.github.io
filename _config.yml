          Developed an identity as a service API's to authenticate and authorize identity of individuals and applications. The service supported the <mark>OpenID Connect</mark>, <mark>SAML</mark>, <mark>Authorize Code</mark>, <mark>Password</mark>, <mark>Client Credentials</mark>, <mark>Authorize Code with PKCE</mark> and <mark>Refresh Token</mark> flow. Created a serverless <mark>AWS Lambda</mark> which triggered every day to report users data on daily basis for analytics purpose. Used AWS managed <mark>Kafka</mark> for data streaming. In addition also performed threat modelling and supported penetration testing team. Made sure the penetration testing issues are immediately fixed to make the system secure before its production release.

          Developed a profile as a service using <mark>GraphQL</mark> to manage the profile data of individuals. Utilized GraphQL to read, write, update and delete only the sections of profile as requested by the user. Also incorporated the CCPA (US) and GDPR (EU) to comply with the act and also made sure the PII data is encrypted.

          I started this project as a final year undergrad project to learn <mark>Machine Learning</mark>. The model was trained using <mark>LSTM</mark> <mark>RNN</mark> algorithm to predict the solar power generated. The project had a interactice UI where the user selects the city name and in the backend the future weather data of the city was fetched using <mark>REST API</mark> and sent to the trained model which predicted the solar power generation.

          Solving 21st century banking problems through softwares and making game changing products.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Every company needs its softwares properly crafted and J P Morgan Chase & Co is no exception. Developing softwares which is clean, optimized, follows coding best practices is hard and I play my part making sure the whole world banking problem is not a problem anymore.

          I worked here as a part of a scrum team consisting of 4 Developers, 1 Tester and a PO/BA. I spent most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>Angular</mark> app that talks to multiple API's built using a collection of <mark>.Net Core</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including creating API's, integrating microservices, deploying code and making sure to follow best practices in a microservice.

          Recently we took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. We as a team worked together with the architects and designers to create something that would be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. We then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous system with no issues.

          During my time at JPMC, I gained experience working with a continuous integration workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark>, image hosting using <mark>Docker</mark>, microservice orchestration through <mark>Kubernetes</mark> and working with <mark>Amazon Web Services</mark> for deployments. We built most of our software using the stack <mark>C#</mark>, <mark>.Net Core</mark>, <mark>Cassandra</mark>, <mark>GraphQL</mark>, and <mark>Redis</mark>.

          For 12 months I was working on delivering a standalone Identity and Access Management + Profile application that services all our user base. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> while working on <mark>Kibana</mark> to provide search functionality for logging. During the project I spent time out of hours communicating with the onshore team, performing deployments and providing support.

          Towards the end of my time at JPMC my role involved assisting with the company’s <mark>DevOps</mark>, this included managing our AWS infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating data. I also spent time configuring and maintaining our applications SSO, this mostly involves configuring new applications and client who are using <mark>ADFS</mark>, <mark>SAML</mark>, <mark>Client Credentials</mark> but also maintaining our software’s SSO functionality.

          I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a person for knowledge seeker within my team and the other teams in the office. I am always looking to gain improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service to the customers while also developing to the highest standard products.

          I am currently enrolled here as a full time *Masters of Science* graduate student in *Computer Science* with specialization in *Machine Learning*. I plan to take software development and machine learning related courses to broaden my ideas around it.

          This is just the starting of my time at University, there's a lot more that I need to learn here. Will keep everyone posted, stay tuned.

          During my degree at Pune University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to my advantage in my day to day work.

          While at University I served as *Technical Secretary*, managed labs, students requirement and ran weekly meetings to oversee progress of task in the department. During this time I also organized a department level inter college technical festival which was a huge success.

          I also had an wonderful experience working as a *Campus Ambassador* for the initiative *Transform Maharashtra*. Promoted the event and encouraged students to participate in sharing their ideas on how to tackle major problems being faced by the State Government of Maharashtra. Alongside promotion, I also managed the end to end interaction of participants with the organizers, effectively resolving their queries.

  - title: When I'm Not Developing
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      When I’m not at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors (mostly mountains). I do a lot of fitness and recreation activity such as treking, running, and meditation as well as trying to make time for things like cooking and watching movies. Since my time at university I have developed a very keen interest for theatre, movies and play of all genre.
      
      I’m interested in art and music as I like to be creative, this is mainly through instagram and films but I also enjoy abstract art too.

      Finally during the rest of my free time alongside my interests in software engineering you will find me do research on:
      - Physics and Space Science
      - [Becoming a spy](https://youtu.be/rleXyBQRc-M)

      Look at this cool image of [Spiti Valley](https://goo.gl/maps/6EuHg3TqWBMzmR999) from one of my trip to the majestic Himalayas.
